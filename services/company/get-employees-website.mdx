## When to Use

Use this endpoint to scrape employee information directly from a company's **team page** or **about page** on their website.

**This endpoint is for:**

- Getting basic employee info from company websites
- Companies that may not have LinkedIn presence
- Supplementing LinkedIn data with website-sourced employees

**NOT for:**

- Getting enriched LinkedIn profiles with full work history (use [`getEmployeesFromLinkedin`](/services/company/get-employees-linkedin) instead)
- Advanced filtering by department, skills, location, etc.

## Method

```typescript
services.company.getEmployeesFromWebsite(params);
```

## Input

<ParamField path="website" type="string" required>
  Company website URL (e.g., `"https://acme.com"`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="options.limit" type="number" optional>
  Max employees to return (default: 100)
</ParamField>

## Output

Returns an array of employee objects with basic information scraped from the website:

<ResponseField name="name_first" type="string">
  First name
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name_last" type="string">
  Last name
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="full_name" type="string">
  Full name
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="job_title" type="string">
  Job title as listed on the website
</ResponseField>

## Example

```typescript
const employees = await services.company.getEmployeesFromWebsite({
  website: "https://acme.com",
  options: { limit: 50 },
});

return employees;
```

## Output Example

```json
[
  {
    "name_first": "Jane",
    "name_last": "Smith",
    "full_name": "Jane Smith",
    "job_title": "CEO"
  },
  {
    "name_first": "John",
    "name_last": "Doe",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "job_title": "VP of Engineering"
  }
]
```

## Comparison with LinkedIn Employees

| Feature                   | `getEmployeesFromWebsite`  | `getEmployeesFromLinkedin`               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Data source**           | Company website            | LinkedIn/Coresignal                      |
| **Fields returned**       | Basic (name, title)        | Full profile (experience, skills, etc.)  |
| **Filtering**             | None                       | Advanced FilterSpec API                  |
| **Best for**              | Quick scrape, no LinkedIn  | Enriched data, advanced filtering        |
| **Current employee only** | Typically yes (team pages) | Requires `notExists` filter on `date_to` |

<Tip>
  For the most comprehensive employee data, use `getEmployeesFromLinkedin` with
  the company's LinkedIn URL. Use `getEmployeesFromWebsite` when you need a
  quick scrape or the company doesn't have a LinkedIn presence.
