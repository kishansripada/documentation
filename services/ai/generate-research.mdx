## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Specific Questions**: The more specific your research query, the more focused and useful the report will be. Include specific aspects you want covered.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Cost Management**: Research reports are expensive due to extensive web searching and analysis. Use them for important research needs, not casual questions.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Report Quality**: Research reports include citations and sources from the web, making them more reliable than standard text generation for factual information.
</Info>

## Cost Optimization

```typescript
// For quick facts, use generateText with web search (cheaper)
const quickAnswer = await services.ai.generateText({
  prompt: "What is the current market cap of Apple?",
  model: "gpt-5-mini",
  enableWebSearch: true
});

// For comprehensive research, use generateResearch
const fullReport = await services.ai.generateResearch({
  query: "Comprehensive analysis of Apple's financial performance and market position"
});
```

## Combining with Other Services

```typescript
// Research a company and enrich with LinkedIn data
async function comprehensiveCompanyResearch(companyName: string) {
  // Get LinkedIn data
  const linkedinUrl = await services.company.linkedin.findUrl({
    name: companyName
  });
  
  const companyData = await services.company.linkedin.enrich({
    url: linkedinUrl!,
    enrichLevel: "extended"
  });
  
  // Get web research
  const research = await services.ai.generateResearch({
    query: `
      Research ${companyName} focusing on:
      - Recent news and developments
      - Market perception and reputation
      - Strategic initiatives
      - Competitive positioning
    `
  });
  
  return {
    linkedinData: companyData,
    webResearch: research.content,
    totalCost: research.cost
  };
}
```

## Monitoring Costs

```typescript
async function researchWithBudget(query: string, maxCost: number) {
  console.log(`Starting research with max budget: $${maxCost}`);
  
  const result = await services.ai.generateResearch({ query });
  
  console.log(`Research completed. Cost: $${result.cost}`);
  
  if (result.cost > maxCost) {
    console.warn(`Warning: Cost exceeded budget by $${result.cost - maxCost}`);
  }
  
  return {
    content: result.content,
    cost: result.cost,
    withinBudget: result.cost <= maxCost
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

```typescript
async function researchSafely(query: string) {
  try {
    const result = await services.ai.generateResearch({ query });
    
    if (!result.content || result.content.length < 100) {
      throw new Error("Research report too short or empty");
    }
    
    return {
      success: true,
      report: result.content,
      cost: result.cost
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Research failed:", error);
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error.message
    };
  }
}
```

## Report Structure

Research reports typically include:

- **Executive Summary**: Key findings and conclusions
- **Introduction**: Context and scope of research
- **Main Body**: Detailed analysis organized by topic
- **Data and Statistics**: Current figures and trends
- **Sources**: Citations and references
- **Conclusion**: Summary and implications

The AI automatically structures the report based on your query and the information found.
