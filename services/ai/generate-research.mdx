## Generate Research Report

<Warning>
  **Premium Feature**: This performs extensive, deep research across many sources. It's significantly more expensive than other AI services but provides the most thorough, well-researched content with citations.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **When to Use**: Reserve this for intensive research needs like market analysis, competitive intelligence, due diligence, or comprehensive industry reports. For simpler questions, use `generateText` with web search instead.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Specific Questions**: The more specific your research query, the more focused and useful the report will be. Include specific aspects you want covered.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Cost Management**: Research reports are expensive due to extensive web searching and analysis. Use them for important research needs, not casual questions.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Report Quality**: Research reports include citations and sources from the web, making them more reliable than standard text generation for factual information.
