## Overview

AI services provide powerful tools for generating content, extracting structured data, and conducting deep research using state-of-the-art language models.

## Choosing the Right Tool

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="📊 Extracting Data from a Specific Website" icon="globe">
    **Use: Scrape + Generate Object**
    
    Perfect for gathering structured information from a known website. For example:
    - "How many physicians are at this doctor's office?"
    - "What are the product prices on this page?"
    - "Extract all team members from the about page"
    
    ```typescript
    const scraped = await services.scrape.website({ url: "https://example.com" });
    const data = await services.ai.generateObject({
      prompt: `How many physicians work here? ${scraped.markdown}`,
      schema: z.object({ physician_count: z.number(), names: z.array(z.string()) })
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🔍 Answering Complex Questions (Not on a Specific Site)" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Use: Generate Text with Web Search**
    
    Best for questions that require searching across multiple sources. For example:
    - "What are the top CRM tools for small businesses?"
    - "How does quantum computing work?"
    - "What are the latest developments in renewable energy?"
    
    ```typescript
    const result = await services.ai.generateText({
      prompt: "What are the best practices for API security in 2024?",
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      enableWebSearch: true
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="📚 Deep, Comprehensive Research" icon="book">
    **Use: Generate Research**
    
    For intensive research requiring thorough analysis across many sources. For example:
    - "Comprehensive market analysis of the EV industry"
    - "Due diligence report on Company X"
    - "Complete competitive analysis of top 5 CRM platforms"
    
    ```typescript
    const result = await services.ai.generateResearch({
      query: "Analyze the current state of the electric vehicle market with growth projections"
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
