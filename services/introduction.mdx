## Getting Started

All enrichments are fully typed with TypeScript definitions. Just call `services.` and go:

```typescript
// Find a LinkedIn profile
const linkedinUrl = await services.person.linkedin.findUrl({
   name: "John Doe",
   company: "Acme Corp",
});

// Enrich company data
const companyData = await services.company.linkedin.enrich({
   url: "https://linkedin.com/company/acme",
});

// Get contact info
const contact = await services.person.contact.get({
   linkedinUrl,
   required: ["email"],
});
```
