## Overview

`ctx.thisRow` provides convenient methods to read and write data on the currently executing row. This is the most common way to interact with your data within column formulas.

<Note>
   `ctx.thisRow` is **not available** in webhook columns, as there is no "current row" context during webhook execution.
</Note>

## Methods

### get()

Get a value from the current row by column name.

```typescript
ctx.thisRow.get(columnName: string): any
```

**Parameters:**

-  `columnName` - The name of the column to read from

**Returns:** The value stored in that column for the current row

**Example:**

```typescript
const email = ctx.thisRow.get("email");
const companyName = ctx.thisRow.get("company");
```

#### Foreign Key Navigation

For foreign key columns, use the **referenced sheet name** instead of the column name, and use dot notation to access fields on the related record:

```typescript
// If "company_id" is a foreign key to the "Companies" sheet
const companyName = ctx.thisRow.get("Companies.name");
const companyWebsite = ctx.thisRow.get("Companies.website");

// You can chain through multiple relationships
const ownerEmail = ctx.thisRow.get("Companies.Owner.email");
```
