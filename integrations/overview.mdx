# Integrations

Orange Slice provides native integration clients for popular CRM and outreach platforms. These clients are fully typed and ready to use directly in your column code—once configured.

<Warning>
  **You must configure an integration before your agent can access it.** Only
  the integrations you configure will appear in the type layer and be available
  in your column code.
</Warning>

## Configuring Integrations

To configure an integration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your spreadsheet">
    Navigate to your spreadsheet at `orangeslice.com/spreadsheets/<spreadsheet_id>/edit`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Integrations panel">
    In the left-hand panel, click **Integrations** at the bottom.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your integration">
    Select the integration you want to configure and enter your credentials (API key, access token, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once configured, the integration will be available in your column code via the `integrations` object.

## Using Integrations in Code

Once configured, use integrations directly in your column code:

```typescript
// After configuring HubSpot in the Integrations panel
const contact = await integrations.hubspot.createContact({
  properties: { email: "john@example.com", firstname: "John" },
});

// After configuring Instantly in the Integrations panel
const campaigns = await integrations.instantly.listCampaigns();
```

<Note>
  If you try to use an integration that hasn't been configured, you'll get an
  error. Make sure to configure the integration in the left panel before using
  it in your code.
</Note>

## Error Handling

All integration methods throw errors on API failures. Use try/catch to handle them:

```typescript
try {
  const contact = await integrations.hubspot.getContact("contact-id");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("API Error:", error.message);
  // Handle the error appropriately
}
```

## Type Safety

All integrations are fully typed with TypeScript. You get autocomplete and type checking for:

- Method parameters
- Response objects
- Filter operators and enums

```typescript
// Full autocomplete support
const result = await integrations.hubspot.searchContacts({
  filterGroups: [
    {
      filters: [
        {
          propertyName: "email",
          operator: "EQ", // Typed enum values
          value: "john@example.com",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```
