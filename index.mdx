## What is Orange Slice?

Orange Slice is a **TypeScript library built for sales**. Write the logic, we figure out the order—no drag-and-drop, no manual connections, just code.

Access a fully-typed library of data enrichments—from LinkedIn profiles to contact info to company intelligence. Just type `services.` and let your editor guide you.

-  **LinkedIn Profiles** - Full profile enrichment with work history, skills & education
-  **Contact Info** - Work emails, personal emails & phone numbers
-  **Company Intel** - Firmographics, financials, traffic & headcount trends
-  **Employee Search** - Find decision makers by title, department & seniority
-  **AI Research** - Deep research reports with live web access
-  **Web Scraping** - Extract data from any website with AI parsing

## The `ctx` Object: Your Primary Interface

The **`ctx` (context) object** is your main way to interact with your workflow. Most commonly, you'll use it to **reference other columns in the same row**:

```typescript
// Get prospect data from other columns in the current row
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");
const title = ctx.thisRow.get("Title");

// Generate personalized outreach message
const outreach = await services.ai.generateText({
   prompt: `Write a personalized cold email to ${name}, ${title} at ${company}. 
   Keep it under 100 words and focus on how we help sales teams save time.`,
   model: "gpt-5-mini",
});

return outreach.text;
```

Beyond reading cells, `ctx` lets you navigate between sheets, add rows, and control workflow execution. [Learn more about ctx →](/ctx/overview)

## The `services` Object: Every Enrichment You Need

The **`services` object** gives you access to a fully-typed library of data enrichments. Just type `services.` and let your editor guide you:

```typescript
// Combine ctx (reading cells) with services (enrichment)
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");

const linkedin = await services.person.linkedin.findUrl({
   name,
   company,
});

return linkedin;
```

## The `webhook` Object: Receive External Data

The **`webhook` object** allows your workflow to receive HTTP requests from external services, forms, and APIs:

```typescript
// Receive form submissions or API webhooks
console.log(`Received ${webhook.method} request from ${webhook.ip}`);

// Automatically add webhook data to a sheet
webhook.addRootFieldsToSheet("Leads", true);

// Or process manually with custom logic
await ctx.sheet("Leads").addRow({
   email: webhook.body.email,
   name: webhook.body.name,
   source: webhook.query.source || "website",
   received_at: new Date(webhook.receivedAt).toISOString(),
});

return { success: true };
```

## How It Works

### Write TypeScript in Columns

Each column runs TypeScript code. Reference other columns with `ctx.thisRow.get()`:

```typescript
// Find a prospect's LinkedIn profile
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");

const linkedin = await services.person.linkedin.findUrl({
   name,
   company,
});

return linkedin;
```

### Workflows That Wire Themselves

Write the logic, we figure out the order. No drag-and-drop, no manual connections—just code.

### Run at Scale

Process thousands of rows in parallel with automatic dependency resolution and progress tracking.
