## What is Orange Slice?

Orange Slice is a **programmable spreadsheet** for sales teams. Each column can run custom JavaScript/TypeScript code with access to:

-  **Data enrichment APIs** - LinkedIn profiles, contact info, company data, web scraping
-  **AI models** - Generate personalized content, extract structured data, research companies
-  **Webhooks** - Receive data from external services and forms

Unlike traditional spreadsheets, you can enrich thousands of rows in parallel with automatic dependency resolution and progress tracking.

## The `ctx` Object: Your Primary Interface

The **`ctx` (context) object** is your main way to interact with the spreadsheet. Most commonly, you'll use it to **reference other columns in the same row**:

```typescript
// Get prospect data from other columns in the current row
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");
const title = ctx.thisRow.get("Title");

// Generate personalized outreach message
const outreach = await services.ai.generateText({
   prompt: `Write a personalized cold email to ${name}, ${title} at ${company}. 
   Keep it under 100 words and focus on how we help sales teams save time.`,
   model: "gpt-5-mini",
});

return outreach.text;
```

Beyond reading cells, `ctx` lets you write values, navigate between sheets, add rows, and control workflow execution. [Learn more about ctx →](/ctx/overview)

## The `services` Object: Data Enrichment

The **`services` object** gives you access to external data sources and AI capabilities:

```typescript
// Combine ctx (reading cells) with services (enrichment)
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");

const linkedin = await services.person.linkedin.findUrl({
   name,
   company,
});

return linkedin;
```

## The `webhook` Object: Receive External Data

The **`webhook` object** allows your spreadsheet to receive HTTP requests from external services, forms, and APIs:

```typescript
// Receive form submissions or API webhooks
console.log(`Received ${webhook.method} request from ${webhook.ip}`);

// Automatically add webhook data to a sheet
webhook.addRootFieldsToSheet("Leads", true);

// Or process manually with custom logic
await ctx.sheet("Leads").addRow({
   email: webhook.body.email,
   name: webhook.body.name,
   source: webhook.query.source || "website",
   received_at: new Date(webhook.receivedAt).toISOString(),
});

return { success: true };
```

## How It Works

### Write Code in Columns

Each column can run JavaScript/TypeScript code. Reference other columns with `ctx.thisRow.get()`:

```typescript
// Find a prospect's LinkedIn profile
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");

const linkedin = await services.person.linkedin.findUrl({
   name,
   company,
});

return linkedin;
```

### Use Built-in Services

Access data enrichment and AI services:

-  **LinkedIn** - Find profiles, get employees, enrich company data
-  **Contact Info** - Get verified emails and phone numbers
-  **Web Scraping** - Extract data from any website
-  **AI** - Generate text, extract structured data, research companies

### Run at Scale

Process thousands of rows in parallel with automatic dependency resolution and progress tracking.
