## What is Orange Slice?

Orange Slice is an **AI-powered spreadsheet** that transforms how sales teams research, enrich, and qualify leads. Think of it as a supercharged spreadsheet where every column can be programmable, AI-powered, and connected to hundreds of data sources—all without writing complex code.

Unlike traditional spreadsheets, Orange Slice combines:

-  **Familiar spreadsheet interface** with the power of custom JavaScript/TypeScript code
-  **AI chat assistant** that writes code, creates columns, and runs bulk operations for you
-  **Built-in data enrichment** from LinkedIn, company databases, web scraping, and contact APIs
-  **Parallel processing** to enrich thousands of rows automatically with progress tracking

Whether you're finding LinkedIn profiles, generating personalized outreach, or scraping company data, Orange Slice makes it as simple as asking your AI assistant or writing a few lines of code.

## The `ctx` Object: Your Primary Interface

The **`ctx` (context) object** is your main way to interact with the spreadsheet. Most commonly, you'll use it to **reference other columns in the same row**:

```typescript
// Get prospect data from other columns in the current row
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");
const title = ctx.thisRow.get("Title");

// Generate personalized outreach message
const outreach = await services.ai.generateText({
   prompt: `Write a personalized cold email to ${name}, ${title} at ${company}. 
   Keep it under 100 words and focus on how we help sales teams save time.`,
   model: "gpt-5-mini",
});

return outreach.text;
```

Beyond reading cells, `ctx` lets you write values, navigate between sheets, add rows, and control workflow execution. [Learn more about ctx →](/ctx/overview)

## The `services` Object: Data Enrichment

The **`services` object** gives you access to external data sources and AI capabilities:

```typescript
// Combine ctx (reading cells) with services (enrichment)
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");

const linkedin = await services.person.linkedin.findUrl({
   name,
   company,
});

// Enrich the profile and store data
if (linkedin) {
   const profile = await services.person.linkedin.enrich({ url: linkedin });
   ctx.thisRow.set({
      "LinkedIn URL": linkedin,
      Title: profile.job_title,
      Location: profile.location_city,
   });
}

return linkedin;
```

## The `webhook` Object: Receive External Data

The **`webhook` object** allows your spreadsheet to receive HTTP requests from external services, forms, and APIs:

```typescript
// Receive form submissions or API webhooks
console.log(`Received ${webhook.method} request from ${webhook.ip}`);

// Automatically add webhook data to a sheet
webhook.addRootFieldsToSheet("Leads", true);

// Or process manually with custom logic
await ctx.sheet("Leads").addRow({
   email: webhook.body.email,
   name: webhook.body.name,
   source: webhook.query.source || "website",
   received_at: new Date(webhook.receivedAt).toISOString(),
});

return { success: true };
```
