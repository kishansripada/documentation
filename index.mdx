## What is Orange Slice?

Orange Slice is an **AI-powered spreadsheet** that transforms how sales teams research, enrich, and qualify leads. Think of it as a supercharged spreadsheet where every column can be programmable, AI-powered, and connected to hundreds of data sources—all without writing complex code.

Unlike traditional spreadsheets, Orange Slice combines:

-  **Familiar spreadsheet interface** with the power of custom JavaScript/TypeScript code
-  **AI chat assistant** that writes code, creates columns, and runs bulk operations for you
-  **Built-in data enrichment** from LinkedIn, company databases, web scraping, and contact APIs
-  **Parallel processing** to enrich thousands of rows automatically with progress tracking

Whether you're finding LinkedIn profiles, generating personalized outreach, or scraping company data, Orange Slice makes it as simple as asking your AI assistant or writing a few lines of code.

## The `ctx` Object: Your Primary Interface

The **`ctx` (context) object** is your main way to interact with the spreadsheet. Most commonly, you'll use it to **reference other columns in the same row**:

```typescript
// Get values from other columns in the current row
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("Name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("Company");
const title = ctx.thisRow.get("Title");

// Use those values in your logic
return `${name} is a ${title} at ${company}`;
```

Beyond reading cells, `ctx` lets you write values, navigate between sheets, add rows, and control workflow execution. [Learn more about ctx →](/ctx/overview)

## The `services` Object: Data Enrichment

The **`services` object** gives you access to external data sources and AI capabilities:

```typescript
// Combine ctx (reading cells) with services (enrichment)
const linkedin = await services.person.linkedin.findUrl({
   name: ctx.thisRow.get("Name"),
   company: ctx.thisRow.get("Company"),
});

return linkedin;
```
