## What is Orange Slice?

Orange Slice is an **AI-powered spreadsheet** that transforms how sales teams research, enrich, and qualify leads. Think of it as a supercharged spreadsheet where every column can be programmable, AI-powered, and connected to hundreds of data sources—all without writing complex code.

Unlike traditional spreadsheets, Orange Slice combines:

-  **Familiar spreadsheet interface** with the power of custom JavaScript/TypeScript code
-  **AI chat assistant** that writes code, creates columns, and runs bulk operations for you
-  **Built-in data enrichment** from LinkedIn, company databases, web scraping, and contact APIs
-  **Parallel processing** to enrich thousands of rows automatically with progress tracking

Whether you're finding LinkedIn profiles, generating personalized outreach, or scraping company data, Orange Slice makes it as simple as asking your AI assistant or writing a few lines of code.

## Two Powerful Globals

Every column formula has access to two global objects:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
   <Card title="ctx" icon="code" href="/ctx/overview">
      **Context Object** - Interact with your spreadsheet Read/write cell values, navigate sheets, add rows, and control
      workflow execution.
   </Card>
   <Card title="services" icon="layer-group" href="/services/introduction">
      **Services** - Access data enrichment APIs LinkedIn data, contact info, web scraping, AI generation, and more.
   </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// Use ctx to read data from your spreadsheet
const name = ctx.thisRow.get("name");
const company = ctx.thisRow.get("company");

// Use services to enrich with external data
const linkedin = await services.person.linkedin.findUrl({
   name: name,
   company: company,
});

// Use ctx to write results back
ctx.thisRow.set({ linkedin_url: linkedin });
```

## Key Capabilities

   name: ctx.thisRow.get("name"),
   company: ctx.thisRow.get("company"),
});

return linkedin;
```
